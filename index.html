        <h2 class="flexIntroItem">Hi! I'm Ashley....</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="flexIntroItem"> Eager to become an excellent backend developer, with knowledge on HTML and CSS. 
            </p><br> 
            <p class="flexIntroItem"> 
                    I am currently employed at Blue Cross Blue Shield of NC as a Senior Systems Analyst in their IT department. 
                </p><br>
                <p class="flexIntroItem">
                        During my 18 years at BCNC, I have gained vast knowledge and skills that have benefited me well during my career.
                </p><br>
                <p class="flexIntroItem">
                        I first started my tenure as a claims processor, where I spent 7 years on the business side of things 
                        before realizing it wasn't for me. I found myself always trying to "fix" whatever problems I encountered 
                        instead of just passing it on to someone who could <em>actually</em> fix the problem.
                </p><br>
                <p class="flexIntroItem">
                        In 2007 I began working as a User Acceptance Tester, where I discovered my <strong>love</strong> for finding problems. 
                        It was during our transition to our new platform, Facets, that I was offered the opportunity to work on 
                        one of our start up teams. In 2015 I joined that team permanently as a Systems Analyst -- and am very excited 
                        expand my career path as a backend programmer!
